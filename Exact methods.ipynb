    "operations research Johnson's rule is a method of scheduling jobs in two work centers. Its primary objective is to find an optimal sequence of jobs to reduce makespan (the total amount of time it takes to complete all jobs). It also reduces the number of idle time between the two work centers. Results are not always optimal, especially for a small group of jobs.\n",
