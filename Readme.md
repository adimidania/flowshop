# Flowshop scheduling problem

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks focused on optimization algorithms that are designed to solve the flowshop problem. This serves as a project for the Optimization techniques and Artificial Intelligence course at the Higher School of Computer Science ESI.

Note that all the algorithms have been implemented based our coursework, you can find all the lecutres on Tresor ESI via this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RyTrSUDc49CV-7s_mXEIWBqdLzSNkcy7).
